# MTX Model 3.0 Tutorial #

[MaAsLin 3](http://huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu/maaslin3) (Microbiome
Multivariable Association with Linear Models) now directly incorporates
[the MTX model](https://github.com/biobakery/MTX_model) built for
metatranscriptomics (MTX) differential gene expression analysis. It
integrates feature-specific covariates to determine multivariable
associations between metadata and microbial MTX features since RNA
expression changes within a microbial community are highly affected by
the underlying differences in metagenomic abundances (i.e. gene copy
number or the abundance of a given microbe). MaAsLin 3 can adjust for
the feature DNA abundance as a continuous covariate for a given RNA
feature in the model, allowing for robust differential expression
analysis in microbial communities.

## 1. Description {#1-description}

In this tutorial, we will walk through most of the steps from [the MTX
model
manuscript](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btab327).
We will compare the output of unadjusted MaAsLin 3 runs on MTX data with
ratio-adjusted MTX data using DNA copy number and MTX abundance data
adjusted with DNA abundances.

# 2. Installation {#1-installation}

The latest development version of MaAsLin 3 can be installed from GitHub
using the `devtools` package. For MaAsLin 3 to install, you will need R
>= 4.4. If your version is older than that, please refer to section
[Installing R for the first
time](https://github.com/biobakery/biobakery/wiki/maaslin3#1-installing-r)
from the MaAsLin 3 tutorial to download the latest R.

```{r, eval=FALSE, cache = FALSE}
# Install devtools if not present
if (!require('devtools', character.only = TRUE)) {
    install.packages('devtools')
}

# Install MaAsLin 3
library("devtools")
install_github("biobakery/maaslin3")
```

```{r, eval=TRUE, cache = FALSE, echo=FALSE}
for (lib in c('maaslin3', 'dplyr', 'ggplot2', 'knitr')) {
    suppressPackageStartupMessages(require(lib, character.only = TRUE))
}
```

# 3. Running the MTX model {#3-running-the-mtx-model}

The MTX model in MaAsLin 3 can be run from the command line or as an R
function. Both methods require the same arguments, have the same
options, and use the same default settings.

## 3.1 Input Files {#31-input-files}

### 3.1.1 Required inputs {#311-required-inputs}
The MTX model in MaAsLin 3 requires three input files:

1. A feature table of RNA abundances - we generated this with [HUMAnN
2](https://huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu/humann2/)
    * Formatted with features as columns and samples as rows.
    * The transposition of this format is also okay.
    * Possible features in this file include RNA abundance of genes,
    enzymes, or pathways.
    * This can be a filepath to a tab-delimited file.
2. Covariate DNA data of features file
    * Formatted with features as columns and samples as rows.
    * The transposition of this format is also okay.
    * Possible data in this file include DNA abundance of genes, enzymes, or
    pathways.
    * This can be a filepath to a tab-delimited file.
3. Metadata file
    * Formatted with features as columns and samples as rows.
    * The transposition of this format is also okay.
    * Possible metadata in this file include pH, disease status, or age.
    * This can be a filepath to a tab-delimited file.

The data file can contain samples not included in the metadata file (as
is true for the reverse case of more samples in the metadata). For both
cases, those samples that are not included in both files will be removed
prior to model construction. Additionally, The sample order within the
files does not need to match as MaAsLin 3 will double check this.

### 3.1.2 Examples of input files {#312-examples-of-input-files}

Example input files can be found in the ``inst/extdata`` folder of the
MaAsLin 3 source. The files provided were generated from the HMP2 data
which can be downloaded from https://ibdmdb.org/.

* ``HMP2_pwyRNA.tsv``: a tab-delimited file with pathways as columns and
samples as rows. It is a subset of the pathway file so it just includes
the pathway RNA abundances for all samples.
* ``HMP2_pwyDNA.tsv``: a tab-delimited file with pathways as columns and
samples as rows. It is a subset of the pathway file so it just includes
the pathway DNA abundances for all samples.
* ``HMP2_pwy.RNA_DNA_ratio.tsv``: a tab-delimited file with pathways as
columns and samples as rows. It is a subset of the pathway file so it
just includes the pathway RNA abundances for all samples and it has been
normalized as a ratio of the underlying (matched) DNA abundances.
* ``HMP2_metadata.tsv``: a tab-delimited file with samples as rows and
metadata as columns. It is a subset of the metadata file that just
includes some of the fields.

## 3.2 Output files {#32-output-files}

Running the MTX model in MaAsLin 3 generates the same output files as
usual. See more details in the [MaAsLin 3
manual](https://github.com/biobakery/maaslin3?tab=readme-ov-file#output-files).

## 3.3 Running models in R {#33-running-models-in-R}

Next, we are going to run the model in three different ways:

1. Run MaAsLin 3 on the raw RNA abundances from HUMAnN
2. Run MaAsLin 3 on the RNA/DNA ratios, which were created using a
helper script from HUMAnN on paired MGX/MTX data
3. Run the MTX model in MaAsLin 3 to adjust the raw RNA abundance by the
underlying DNA abundances

### 3.3.1 Raw RNA Abundances with MaAsLin 3 {#331-raw}

In this first example run on MTX data, we will run MaAsLin 3 on the RNA
pathway abundances as characterized by HUMAnN 2 but not normalized by
the matched DNA of these samples. (Make sure to set
`include=T` to view the plots when knitting the Rmd.)

```{R, echo = TRUE, results = 'hide', warning = FALSE, cache = TRUE}
set.seed(1)
fit_maaslin_rna <- maaslin3(
    input_data = df_input_data,
    input_metadata = df_input_metadata,
    output = 'demo_output_rna',
    fixed_effects = c('diagnosis', 'dysbiosis_state', 'antibiotics', 'age'),
    random_effects = c('participant_id'),
    coef_plot_vars = c('dysbiosis_state dysbiosis_CD', 'diagnosis CD'),
    heatmap_vars = c('dysbiosis_state dysbiosis_UC', 'diagnosis UC', 'age',
                        'antibiotics Yes'))
```

```{r, out.width='100%', echo=FALSE, cache = TRUE, include=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("demo_output_rna/figures/summary_plot.png")
```

### 3.3.2 RNA/DNA Ratios with MaAsLin 3 {#332-ratio}

Next, we will run the same model changing the input to the RNA/DNA ratio
data frame. Note that we now set `normalization = 'NONE'` so that
MaAsLin 3 does not total-sum scale the ratios.

```{R, echo = TRUE, results = 'hide', warning = FALSE, cache = TRUE}
fit_maaslin_ratio <- maaslin3(
    input_data = df_input_dataratio,
    input_metadata = df_input_metadata,
    output = 'demo_output_ratio',
    fixed_effects = c('diagnosis', 'dysbiosis_state', 'antibiotics', 'age'),
    random_effects = c('participant_id'),
    normalization = 'NONE',
    coef_plot_vars = c('dysbiosis_state dysbiosis_CD', 'diagnosis CD'),
    heatmap_vars = c('dysbiosis_state dysbiosis_UC', 'diagnosis UC', 'age',
                    'antibiotics Yes'), 
    warn_prevalence = FALSE)
```

```{r, out.width='100%', echo=FALSE, cache = TRUE, include=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("demo_output_ratio/figures/summary_plot.png")
```

### 3.3.3 RNA abundance adjusted by DNA abundance with MaAsLin 3 {#333-mtx-mgx}

Finally, we will run the MTX model in MaAsLin 3. We first put the DNA
and RNA abundance files into the MaAsLin 3 function `preprocess_dna_mtx`
to total sum scale the abundances of both and apply the proper
transformation to the DNA abundances. For each sample in each feature,
this function:

1. Log 2 transforms the DNA abundance if the DNA abundance is >=0.
2. Sets the DNA abundance to `log2([minimum relative abundance in the
sample] / 2)` if the corresponding RNA abundance is non-zero but the DNA
abundance is zero.
3. Sets the DNA abundance to NA if both are zero, which excludes the
sample when fitting the model for the feature.

See `?preprocess_dna_mtx` for more details. Now, we will switch the
`input_data` to the preprocessed RNA table `preprocess_out$dna_table`
and include the pre-processed DNA as the feature-specific covariate with
`feature_specific_covariate = preprocess_out$dna_table`. We also set the
name of the covariate for model fitting with
`feature_specific_covariate_name = 'DNA'` and we specify that we do not
want to record the associations with the DNA in the outputs and plots by
setting `feature_specific_covariate_record = FALSE`.

```{R, echo = TRUE, results = 'hide', warning = FALSE, cache = TRUE}
preprocess_out <- preprocess_dna_mtx(df_input_dnadata, df_input_data)

fit_maaslin_mtx_mgx <- maaslin3(
    input_data = preprocess_out$rna_table,
    input_metadata = df_input_metadata,
    output = 'demo_output_mtx_mgx',
    fixed_effects = c('diagnosis', 'dysbiosis_state', 'antibiotics', 'age'),
    random_effects = c('participant_id'),
    feature_specific_covariate = preprocess_out$dna_table,
    feature_specific_covariate_name = 'DNA',
    feature_specific_covariate_record = FALSE,
    coef_plot_vars = c('dysbiosis_state dysbiosis_CD', 'diagnosis CD'),
    heatmap_vars = c('dysbiosis_state dysbiosis_UC', 'diagnosis UC', 'age',
                    'antibiotics Yes'))
```

```{r, out.width='100%', echo=FALSE, cache = TRUE, include=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("demo_output_mtx_mgx/figures/summary_plot.png")
```

## 3.4 Compare output {#34-compare-output}

Finally, let's use some simple R scripts to compare the results from
each model. First, we will look at the number of significant
[dysbiosis](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1237-9)
associations. To do this we will use the base R function ``subset`` to
subset the results to just the ones from the dysbiosis comparisons and
``table`` to count the number of pathways that were associated with
UC/CD in each model.

```{R, cache=TRUE}
#compare the raw counts of features associated with dysbiosis
results_rna = subset(rbind(fit_maaslin_rna$fit_data_abundance$results,
                        fit_maaslin_rna$fit_data_prevalence$results),
                    metadata == "dysbiosis_state" & qval_individual < 0.1 &
                        is.na(error))
table(results_rna$value, results_rna$model)
#              linear logistic
# dysbiosis_CD     58       37
# dysbiosis_UC      8       11

results_rna_ratio =
subset(rbind(fit_maaslin_ratio$fit_data_abundance$results,
                                fit_maaslin_ratio$fit_data_prevalence$results),
                        metadata == "dysbiosis_state" & qval_individual < 0.1 &
                            is.na(error))
table(results_rna_ratio$value, results_rna_ratio$model)
#              linear logistic
# dysbiosis_CD     17        3
# dysbiosis_UC      1        0

results_rna_dna =
subset(rbind(fit_maaslin_mtx_mgx$fit_data_abundance$results,
                            fit_maaslin_mtx_mgx$fit_data_prevalence$results),
                        metadata == "dysbiosis_state" & qval_individual < 0.1 &
                            is.na(error))
table(results_rna_dna$value, results_rna_dna$model)
#              linear logistic
# dysbiosis_CD     42       10
# dysbiosis_UC      1        2
```

As you can tell, this number was highly dependent on the model, with
most results coming from the raw RNA abundances and the least results
from the RNA/DNA ratio.

Next, let's look at which features overlapped between the models. We can
do this with the `intersect` call in R:

```{R, cache=TRUE}
# features called by the RNA/DNA ratios compared to the Raw RNA
# abundances
intersect(results_rna_ratio$feature, results_rna$feature)
# 10 features overlapped

# features called by the Raw RNA abundances compared
# to the RNA abundances adjusted by the DNA abundances
intersect(results_rna$feature, results_rna_dna$feature)
# 47 features overlapped

# features called by the RNA/DNA ratios compared
# to the RNA abundances adjusted by the DNA abundances
intersect(results_rna_ratio$feature, results_rna_dna$feature)
# 11 features overlapped
```

From this, we can see that while the models are calling different total
numbers of pathways, the ones that they are calling are significantly
overlapping.

Finally, let's plot the top CD dysbiosis results in the MTX_model,
across all the models. Here we first create one object that includes all
the results, then subset it to the top 10 pathways in the DNA covariate
results. (Set `include=TRUE` to see the plot.)

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=4, fig.align='center', include=FALSE}
top_pathways <- results_rna_dna$feature[
    order(results_rna_dna$qval_individual)][1:10]

# Specify model type
results_rna$model_type = "RNA model"
results_rna_ratio$model_type = "RNA/DNA ratio"
results_rna_dna$model_type = "RNA with DNA covariate"

# create one object from the results
results = rbind(results_rna, results_rna_dna, results_rna_ratio)
# subset to just the top features in the MaAsLin 3 DNA covariate model
results = results[results$feature %in% top_pathways, ]
# Rename abundance/prevalence
results$model <- ifelse(results$model == 'linear', 'Abundance',
'Prevalence')

# Plot significant CD dysbiosis associations
ggplot(results[results$value == 'dysbiosis_CD',],
    aes(x = coef, y = feature, color = model_type)) +
    geom_point(aes(shape = model), size = 3, alpha = 0.8) +
    geom_errorbar(aes(xmin = coef - stderr, xmax = coef + stderr),
                    width = 0.2) +
    theme_bw() +
    theme(axis.title = ggplot2::element_text(size = 16),
        axis.text = ggplot2::element_text(size = 8),  
    ) +
    xlab('Coefficient +/- SE') +
    ylab('Pathway') +
    labs(color = 'Model', shape = 'Association')
```
Here, you can tell that model choice can influence the effect size,
particularly for the prevalence models.

```{R}
sessionInfo()
```

```{R}

unlink('demo_output_rna', recursive = TRUE)
unlink('demo_output_ratio', recursive = TRUE)
unlink('demo_output_mtx_mgx', recursive = TRUE)
```
